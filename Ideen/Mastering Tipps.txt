For mastering in Ableton Live, a combination of built-in plugins and select third-party tools can create a powerful and professional-sounding final product. The stock Ableton Live plugins provide a solid foundation, with the Glue Compressor being particularly praised for its ability to add punch, weight, and cohesion to mixes, especially on drum buses and full mixes.
 It functions similarly to an analog SSL bus compressor and includes a sidechain with its own equalization.

A recommended mastering chain using only Ableton's stock plugins includes the following steps: starting with the Utility plugin to adjust stereo balance and width, followed by EQ8 for low-cutting and cleanup, then applying Glue Compressor for overall blending.
 Additional stages can include multiband compression for dynamic control, punch and sustain compression, a final EQ8 for fine-tuning, and a limiter to achieve desired loudness.

For those seeking enhanced capabilities, several third-party plugins are frequently recommended. iZotope's Ozone 12 Advanced offers an AI-powered Master Assistant that suggests settings to streamline the mastering process directly within Live.
 Valhalla DSP plugins like Supermassive, Freq Echo, and Space Modulator are noted for their high-quality reverb and delay effects, with some available for free.
 TDR Nova is a highly regarded free parametric EQ, while TDR Kotelnikov serves as an effective free mastering compressor.
 Other popular choices include the Waves Clarity Vx Pro for noise reduction 
 , and the Plugin Alliance bx_digital V3 for high-quality digital processing.

Ultimately, while Ableton's built-in tools are capable of producing professional results, many producers enhance their workflow with third-party plugins that offer specialized features, improved sound quality, or advanced automation and AI-assisted tools.
