["High soprano choir, clear and prominent, ethereal and harmonious"]  
["Choral voices articulate distinctly, moving like puppets of the weavers of fate, yet with an almost playful fluidity"]  
["Sing the following lyrics in an expressive, well-defined operatic style, warm and resonant, with subtle dreamlike echoes"]  
["Reduce distortion to a soft, textured warmth, allowing clarity and depth to shine"]  
["Add surreal, glistening harp arpeggios, airy synth pads, and lightly cascading piano melodies"]  
["Percussion: Gentle, intricate, with a flowing organic rhythm, like rippling water"]  
["Lead vocals upfront, melodic, storytelling, with a commanding yet dreamlike presence, like ancient bardic chants drifting through time"]  
["Ensure vocals remain dominant in the mix with balanced reverb and delay, creating an immersive but not overwhelming space"]
